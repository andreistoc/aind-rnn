In this project I built RNNs that can generate sequences based on input data - with a focus on two applications: The first uses real market data in order to predict future Apple stock prices using an RNN model. The second one is trained on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's classic novel Sherlock Holmes and will generate wacky sentences based on it that may - or may not - become the next great Sherlock Holmes novel!
